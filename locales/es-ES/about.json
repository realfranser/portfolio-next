In 2019 I started working with HTML & CSS to make some minor edits on a small business website that I was operating. What I thought was just a few small edits turned into a love for programming.",

I then started freelancing for e-commerce companies on the Shopify platform. I am now spending my time building projects with React JS, Firebase, and learning new technologies.",
